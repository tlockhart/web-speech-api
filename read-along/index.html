        Science Literacy is a way of approaching the world. It's a way of equipping yourself to interpret what happens in front of you. It's methods and tools that enable it to act as a kind of a utility belt necessary for what you encounter in the moment. It's methods of mathematical analysis, interpretation, some basic laws of physics so when someone says I have these two crystals and if you rub them together you get healthy. Rather than just discount it, because that's as lazy as accepting it, what you should do is inquire. 
        
        So do you know how to inquire? Every scientist would know how to start that conversation. Where did you get these? What does it cure? How does it work? How much does it cost? Can you demonstrate? Science literacy is vaccine against charlatans of the world that would exploit your ignorance of the forces of nature. Become scientifically literate.
